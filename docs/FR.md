# OVERVIEW

## Background

The patent system was institutionalised in France as early as 1791. However, the French patents published before 1900 have not been made publicly available in a digitised format.

!!! info
    The French INPI has manually built a database of inventors' locations spanning over the 19th century. This database is however not publicly available. We are not aware of prior work trying to constitute a database of the location of patentees filing in France for the 1900-1980 period.
