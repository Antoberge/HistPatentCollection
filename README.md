### Models usage

> This section says (code snippets) how to:

>- Load the model
>- Extract NER ~and DEP~~


### Everything you need to know

#### Docs

Each family of models is documented in 2 documents:

- `ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md` reports the annotation guidelines used for creating the gold dataset.
- `CARD.md` reports everything you need to know about the country-specific extraction model(s) and related dataset.


#### Naming conventions

The naming conventions are used both for data and models.

Name| Short| Description
---|---|---
language | `ll` | [ISO2 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
country |`cc` | [ISO2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
type	| `type` | model capabilities (e.g. core for general-purpose model with vocabulary, syntax, entities and word vectors, or depent for only vocab, syntax and entities.)
genre |	`genre` | type of text the model is trained on (e.g. web for web text, news for news text, gbpatent for patent from the GB Patent Office, etc)

See [Spacy/issues#1010](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1010).

### TODO

- [x] Prepare input so as to send unique addresses to batch geocoding API only
- [ ] Migrate :de: and :gb: to md5 (rather than adler32)
- [ ] Make schema for consolidated table
- [ ] Relationship prediction models
